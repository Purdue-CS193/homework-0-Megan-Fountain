# Megan Fountain's First CS193 Homework

Thinks I LOVE about CS193
- It's not super early in the morning. And by super early I mean not before like 10.
- Only meets **once** a week
- Helps learn the random little things like _terminal_ that you are assumed to know
- Mostly the fact that it's not early

### YAY CS193!
